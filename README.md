These days, all we get to hear to is phishing calls, Somebody has stolen something from my bank account or somebody has access to my insurance, and somebody is something. Phishing has
been a regularly encountered phenomenon. Hence I decided to make a project on it, collected a dataset which had all the information about phishing and used all my knowledge which I 
acquired from Network Security. And I submitted it in my class, which I was applauded for. Here comes the preview, I made a correlation map for it and then decided what does it signify?
It signifies the amount of false positives and false negatives. Also found top 10 features that give us the feature importance in Phishing detection. And, figured out which protocol 
has the most influence on the dataset.
